Cesar at Kennedy Space Center, Orlando FL

# Here are some of the things I like:

- Reading esoteric books,
- Listening to classical music,
- Reading about world history,
- Learning about life,
- Traveling,
- Trying fine food and wines,
- Learning about distant lands and people,
- And I like my job a lot!
